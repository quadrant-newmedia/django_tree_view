# django_tree_view

This is a "seed" project for creating a reusable django app.
It aids with packaging the project for pypi, pushing to GitHub, and automating tests using tox.

For a more advanced setup, see https://www.b-list.org/weblog/2018/apr/02/testing-django/

For the python documentation on packagin, see https://packaging.python.org/tutorials/packaging-projects/

## How To Use:
- clone this repo, then delete the origin remote
